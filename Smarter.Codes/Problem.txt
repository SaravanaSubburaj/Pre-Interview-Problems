Steps to perform in this assignment :

Parse the JSON file
Go inside ‘Body > Recommendations’
 Print name of Restaurant
Go inside ‘Body > Recommendations’
 Go inside menu
Loop for each menu (there can be multiple menus)
Check whether type=sectionheader. If it is – go inside its ‘children
Check whether type=item. If it is, check whether selected=1. If both are true, print the name of item, and go inside its children
Check whether selected=1 (no need to pay attention to the ‘type’ now that we are inside children of ‘item’). If selected was 1 then print the name of child, and go further deep inside the children
Repeat the last step infinitely – until we have reached the deepest child

The output should look like this :
Restaurant1
–> Item1
—–> Child1
———-> Child1.1
———-> Child1.2
——> Child2
——> Child3
———-> Child3.1
Take note of length of arrows in each line above. Your output should also contain these arrows to depict the indentation of each child.
